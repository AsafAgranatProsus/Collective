# COLLECTIVE: PRODUCT BRIEF

**The AI that manages your group, so you don't have to**

## THE PROBLEM

Four flatmates share an apartment in Brooklyn. They're good people who like each other. But the group chat is a nightmare.

47 unread messages about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper.

Three separate threads arguing about whether the thermostat setting is reasonable.

A brewing resentment because Marcus hasn't done dishes in two weeks and nobody wants to be the one to say something.

Sarah paid for groceries last week and is still waiting for Venmo requests she had to calculate manually.

The Sunday football team has 15 members and needs to coordinate field bookings, attendance, equipment, and cost-splitting every single week. The group chat has 200 messages and still no confirmed game time.

The family of five has three kids in different activities, conflicting schedules, unclear chore assignments, and every week someone asks "wait, who's picking up Jake from soccer?"

**The pattern is universal: coordinating groups is exhausting.**

Not because people are incompetent. Because **group coordination has high transaction costs and no good tools.**

## THE INSIGHT

Every AI assistant on the market is designed for one person.

Your calendar. Your tasks. Your productivity. Your optimization.

But life's hardest problems aren't individual - they're collective.

Flatmates managing a household. Families coordinating schedules. Sports teams organizing games. Friend groups planning trips. Small teams managing projects.

All of these require: - Balancing multiple people's preferences and constraints - Fair division of labor and costs - Continuous coordination as circumstances change - Shared resource management - Conflict mediation and fairness enforcement

**Microsoft Copilot can't solve this. Google Gemini can't solve this. Siri can't solve this.**

They're designed for individuals, not groups.

**The white space: Multi-tenant agentic AI that serves the GROUP, not the individual.**

## VALIDATED MARKET GAP

Extensive market research (November 2025) confirms **no existing consumer product combines all five critical capabilities:**

**The Five Requirements:** 1. Multi-tenant architecture (serves group as unit, not individual managing group) 2. Autonomous coordination (makes decisions, not just tracks) 3. Cross-resource management (chores + expenses + scheduling + shopping) 4. Fair division algorithms (enforces equity, not just shows data) 5. Consumer-focused (flatmates, families, teams - not enterprise)

**Competitive Landscape:**

**Splitwise:** Expenses only (2/5 capabilities) - Excellent financial tracking and splitting - Zero help with chores, scheduling, or shopping - Passive tracking, no autonomous allocation

**Flatastic/Flatify:** Manual tracking (2/5 capabilities) - Chore lists and basic expense splitting - Requires manual assignment, no AI allocation - Reminder-based, not agentic

**Family AI Assistants (Wolfmates, Milo, Ohai):** Individual serving families (2/5 capabilities) - Parent uses AI to manage family (1:1 architecture) - Not true multi-tenant (group serving itself) - Works for hierarchical families, not peer groups

**Enterprise Multi-Agent Systems:** Business focus (2.5/5 capabilities) - Sophisticated coordination but enterprise-only - Complex, expensive, overcomplicated for consumer use - Zero presence in consumer group coordination

**Research Quote:** "Currently, fully AI-driven apps that autonomously allocate chores and split expenses with advanced AI decision-making are limited; most apps automate reminders, tracking, and fair splitting but rely on user input for chore assignments."

**Validation: Collective is the first to combine all five capabilities in a consumer product.**

## THE CONCEPT

Collective is an agentic AI designed specifically for group coordination.

Not a personal assistant that happens to work with groups. A GROUP assistant that happens to serve individuals within it.

It autonomously manages shared resources, coordinates activities, tracks contributions, enforces fairness, and reduces coordination friction to near-zero.

**You don't manage the group. Collective does.**

## HOW IT WORKS: FLATMATES

Emma, Marcus, Sam, and Sarah move into an apartment together. On day one, they set up Collective.

### Week 1: Onboarding

**Setup takes 10 minutes per person:**

Each flatmate: - Creates account, connects calendar and payment app - Answers preference survey: - "How clean do you like shared spaces? 1-10" - "How often do you cook?" - "Morning person or night owl?" - "What chores do you hate most?"

The group collectively: - Defines shared spaces and responsibilities (kitchen, bathroom, living room, trash, recycling) - Sets fairness model: "Equal rotation" (everyone does equal chores) vs. "Schedule-based" (assigns based on availability) - Links utilities and shared expenses - Creates shared shopping list

Collective now knows: - Everyone's schedules and availability - Household responsibilities and who's responsible - Individual preferences and constraints - How to split costs fairly

**Day 2: First chore assignments**

Collective analyzes schedules for the week and assigns:

**Emma:** - Dishes: Monday, Wednesday, Friday - Trash takeout: Thursday

**Marcus:** - Bathroom cleaning: Saturday morning - Vacuum living room: Sunday

**Sam:** - Kitchen deep clean: Saturday afternoon - Recycling: Tuesday

**Sarah:** - Dishes: Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday - Grocery run coordination

Each person gets notification with their assignments and reasoning: "Emma, you're free Monday evening, so I assigned dishes then. Let me know if this doesn't work."

Everyone can see the full assignment list. Transparent. Fair. No arguments.

### Week 2: Shopping Coordination

**Tuesday 6pm:** Sam notices they're out of milk.

Opens Collective, taps: "Add milk to shopping list."

**Wednesday 3pm:** Emma adds eggs, bread, and coffee.

**Thursday 5:45pm:** Marcus is near Trader Joe's on his way home.

Collective detects his location, sends notification:

"Marcus, you're near Trader Joe's. We need 4 items: milk, eggs, bread, coffee. Estimated cost: \$18. Can you grab these?"

Marcus taps "Yes."

Collective immediately: - Sends Marcus the detailed list - Notifies the group: "Marcus is handling tonight's shopping" - Removes items from shared list - Tracks the expense for splitting later

Marcus shops, pays \$22, taps "Done" in the app.

Collective: - Logs \$22 expense under "Shared groceries" - Calculates split: \$5.50 per person - Sends payment requests to Emma, Sam, and Sarah: "Marcus bought groceries. Your share: \$5.50"

By Friday morning, everyone's paid. No manual calculation. No awkward Venmo requests. No forgotten debts.

### Week 3: Chore Completion Tracking

**Monday evening:** Emma completes dishes, taps "Done" in Collective.

**Tuesday:** Marcus is supposed to handle bathroom cleaning but doesn't.

**Wednesday:** Collective sends gentle reminder: "Marcus, bathroom cleaning from Saturday is still pending. Need to reschedule or want help?"

Marcus is swamped at work, taps "Can someone else take it this week?"

Collective: - Offers to other flatmates: "Marcus needs help with bathroom this week. Who's available?" - Sam volunteers - Collective reassigns, tracks that Marcus owes Sam a chore swap - Next week, Marcus gets an extra chore to balance

**Everyone can see the contribution dashboard:**

**October Chore Completion:** - Emma: 12/12 completed (100%) - Marcus: 9/11 completed (82%, owes 2) - Sam: 13/11 completed (contributed extra) - Sarah: 11/12 completed (92%, owes 1)

Transparent. No resentment. Everyone knows where they stand.

### Week 4: Utility Bill and Expense Management

**November 1:** Electric bill arrives: \$180.

Collective: - Automatically logs expense - Splits evenly: \$45 per person - Sends notification: "Electric bill: \$180. Your share: \$45. Please pay Emma who set up the account." - Sends payment requests to Marcus, Sam, Sarah

**Running expense balance (October):**

Emma: Paid utilities (\$180), bought groceries (\$47). Total out: \$227. Owed: \$170.25

Marcus: Bought groceries (\$22), paid rent deposit (\$800). Total out: \$822. Owed: \$600

Sam: Bought household items (\$31). Total out: \$31. Owed: \$23.25

Sarah: Bought groceries (\$38). Total out: \$38. Owed: \$28.50

**At month-end, Collective settles:**

"Emma is owed \$170.25 total. Marcus owes \$67.50, Sam owes \$46.25, Sarah owes \$56.50."

One settlement per month. Clear. Simple. No spreadsheets.

### Week 5: Household Calendar and Coordination

**Sunday:** Landlord emails about scheduling annual inspection.

Emma forwards to Collective.

Collective: - Checks everyone's calendar - Finds common availability: "All flatmates free: Tuesday 3-5pm or Thursday 10am-12pm" - Sends poll: "Which works for landlord inspection?" - Group votes Thursday 10am - Collective emails landlord: "Thursday 10am-12pm works for all tenants" - Adds to everyone's calendar - Sends reminder Wednesday evening: "Landlord inspection tomorrow 10am. Please tidy shared spaces."

**No group chat chaos. No back-and-forth. Collective handled it.**

### Week 8: Conflict Detection

**Dashboard shows imbalance:**

Marcus: 18 chores assigned, 13 completed (72% completion rate)

Collective flags this privately to Marcus: "You're falling behind on chores. Everything okay? Need to adjust your assignment load?"

Marcus: "Work has been insane. Can we lighten my load for a few weeks?"

Collective: "I can reassign some tasks temporarily. But the group should know. Want me to notify them?"

Marcus agrees.

Collective sends group message: "Marcus is dealing with heavy work period. I'm reducing his chore load by 30% for the next 3 weeks. The difference is split among Emma, Sam, and Sarah. Marcus will make up the balance when work lightens. Everyone okay with this?"

Group agrees. Crisis averted. No resentment. Transparent communication facilitated by AI.

## HOW IT WORKS: AMATEUR SPORTS TEAM

15 people play pickup football every Sunday. They rotate between three different fields depending on availability and weather.

Before Collective: Chaotic group chat, last-minute cancellations, field booking confusion, unclear cost splits, forgotten equipment.

With Collective:

### Every Week

**Monday:** Collective polls the group: "Who's available this Sunday?"

**Tuesday:** 11 people have confirmed (enough for a game).

Collective: - Checks field availability at 3 locations - Lincoln Park: \$80, available 2-5pm - Riverside: \$100, available 3-6pm - Jefferson: \$70, available 1-4pm

- Checks weather forecast (rain predicted 1-3pm Sunday)
- Selects Riverside (game would be 3-6pm, after rain)
- Books field automatically
- Notifies everyone: "Game on! Sunday 3pm, Riverside Field 2. \$9 per person."

**Wednesday:** Two more people join. Now 13 confirmed.

Collective: - Updates cost split: \$7.70 per person - Sends payment requests - By Friday, everyone's paid

**Saturday:** Sarah drops out (family emergency).

Collective: - Checks waitlist (4 people indicated "maybe") - Messages first person: "Opening for tomorrow's game. Interested?" - Jake confirms - Collective notifies group, refunds Sarah, charges Jake

**Sunday morning:** Equipment check.

Collective: "Emma has the ball. Marcus has cones. Bring them please."

**Sunday 2:45pm:** Reminder notifications to all players: "Game starts in 15 minutes. Riverside Field 2."

**After game:** Collective asks: "How was it? Rate the field 1-5."

Tracks field ratings over time to optimize future bookings.

**Season tracking (optional fun feature):** - 12 games played this season - Emma: 11 games (92% attendance) - Marcus: 7 games (58% attendance) - Team record: 7 wins, 5 losses

**Zero group chat messages. Zero confusion. Just show up and play.**

## HOW IT WORKS: FAMILY WITH KIDS

Parents + 3 kids (ages 8, 12, 15). Complex schedules, multiple activities, household management nightmare.

### Monday Morning

Collective sends parents the daily briefing:

**Today's Family Schedule:**

8:30am: Drop 8yo at school (Parent 1) 3:30pm: Pick up 12yo, drive to soccer practice (Parent 2) 4:00pm: Pick up 8yo from school, drive to piano lesson (Parent 1) 5:00pm: Pick up 15yo from debate team (Parent 2) 5:30pm: Pick up 12yo from soccer (Parent 2) 6:00pm: Family dinner (15yo cooking tonight - assigned chore)

**Conflicts detected:** Both parents needed at 5pm. Parent 2 can't pick up both 15yo and 12yo.

**Suggested solution:** 15yo takes bus home from debate (they're old enough, you've approved this previously). Parent 2 picks up 12yo from soccer.

Parents approve suggestion. Collective texts 15yo: "Take the bus home today. See you at 6 for dinner."

### Chore System

Each child has age-appropriate weekly chores:

**8yo:** - Feed cat daily - Put away toys before bed - Help set table for dinner

**12yo:** - Dishes 3x per week - Take out trash and recycling - Vacuum living room Saturday

**15yo:** - Cook family dinner 2x per week (with guidance) - Clean bathroom Saturday - Laundry (own clothes)

Collective tracks completion:

**This week (so far):** - 8yo: 5/7 tasks done - 12yo: 6/9 tasks done (dishes incomplete Tuesday) - 15yo: 8/8 tasks done

**Allowance tied to completion:** - 8yo: \$5/week if 80%+ completion - 12yo: \$10/week if 80%+ completion  
\- 15yo: \$20/week if 90%+ completion

Collective automatically calculates and notifies parents: "Allowance this week: 8yo earned \$5, 12yo earned \$8.75 (87%), 15yo earned \$20."

No arguments. Data-driven. Fair.

### Activity Coordination

Three kids, seven weekly activities, rotating parent duty.

Collective: - Integrates with school calendars, sports team schedules, activity schedules - Optimizes parent pickup/dropoff based on work schedules - Alerts when conflicts arise - Tracks which parent has done more driving (balances load)

**This month:** Parent 1: 14 pickups/dropoffs Parent 2: 18 pickups/dropoffs

Collective: "Parent 2 has handled more driving this month. Rebalancing next week's assignments."

### Meal Planning

Thursday: Both parents working late.

Collective detects scheduling conflict, suggests:

"Kids need dinner Thursday. Options: 1. 15yo can cook spaghetti (they know the recipe) 2. Order pizza (\$25 budget approved) 3. Meal prep: I can remind you to prep Wednesday"

Parents choose option 1.

Collective notifies 15yo Wednesday: "You're cooking dinner tomorrow. Ingredients needed: pasta, sauce, ground beef. They're on the shopping list."

Collective adds items to family shopping list.

Parent 1 shops Thursday morning, items acquired.

15yo cooks Thursday evening. Family dinner happens despite parent schedules.

**No stress. Coordinated autonomously.**

## THE TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Multi-Tenant Data Model

Unlike single-user AI assistants, Collective requires sophisticated multi-user architecture:

**Individual User Accounts:** - Personal calendar, preferences, payment info - Privacy controls (what's visible to group vs. private) - Individual contribution tracking

**Group Entity:** - Separate from individual users - Shared resources (chores, expenses, shopping lists, schedules) - Group preferences and fairness models - Collective decision history

**Permission System:** - What's visible to all group members (chore assignments, expense balances, shared calendar) - What's private (individual calendar details, personal finances) - What requires group consensus (fairness model changes, new member additions)

### Core Integrations

**Calendar Systems:** - Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar - Multi-user OAuth (each person authorizes their own calendar) - Read-only access to personal events (for availability checking) - Write access to shared group calendar

**Payment Platforms:** - Venmo, PayPal, Zelle integration - Automatic expense detection (when someone pays for shared items) - Payment request generation - Settlement optimization (minimize transaction count)

**Shopping and Commerce:** - Shared shopping lists - Integration with grocery delivery (Instacart, Amazon Fresh) - Price tracking and optimization - Inventory management

**Communication:** - SMS, push notifications, email - In-app messaging for group coordination - Integration with existing group chats (optional)

**Location Services:** - Proximity detection (for shopping coordination) - Field/venue booking APIs - Traffic and weather data

**Smart Home (Optional):** - Chore completion verification via sensors - Utility monitoring and alerts - Automated reminders based on household state

### Autonomous Coordination Algorithms

**Fair Division:** - Chore allocation based on preferences, availability, historical contribution - Cost splitting with configurable fairness models (equal, equity-based, preference-weighted) - Contribution balancing over time

**Scheduling Optimization:** - Multi-calendar constraint satisfaction - Availability finding across multiple users - Conflict detection and resolution suggestions - Optimal time selection based on group preferences

**Preference Aggregation:** - Balancing competing desires (cleanliness standards, budget preferences, scheduling needs) - Voting mechanisms for group decisions - Compromise suggestion when preferences conflict

**Proactive Intelligence:** - Pattern recognition in user behavior - Predictive suggestions based on historical data - Anomaly detection (unusual patterns requiring attention) - Optimal timing recommendation (best time for tasks based on energy, availability, context) - Preemptive action (scheduling preventive maintenance, reordering supplies before depletion)

**Personalization:** - Preference learning from implicit feedback - Contextual adaptation (different behavior for work vs. personal time) - Energy and mood pattern detection - Relationship mapping (understanding who matters, interaction frequency, sentiment) - Goal alignment (tracking stated objectives against actual behavior)

### Transparency and Explainability

Critical for trust in multi-tenant context:

Every decision includes reasoning: - "I assigned dishes to Emma because she hasn't had a kitchen chore in 2 weeks" - "I suggested Riverside field because rain is predicted earlier in the day" - "I'm asking Marcus to grab groceries because he's near the store right now"

Contribution dashboards visible to all: - Everyone sees who's done what - No hidden resentments - Data-driven fairness discussions

Override capability: - Group can veto AI decisions - Manual reassignment always possible - AI learns from overrides

## THE DIFFERENTIATION

### Validated Competitive Positioning

**What Competitors Do:**

**Splitwise (2.5/5 capabilities):** - Excellent: Expense tracking, splitting, payment integration - Missing: Chores, scheduling, shopping, autonomous allocation - **Their lane:** Financial calculator for groups - **Our advantage:** Comprehensive coordinator

**Flatastic/Flatify (2/5 capabilities):** - Basic: Chore lists, expense tracking, shopping lists - Missing: Autonomous allocation, fair balancing, proactive intervention - **Their lane:** Manual tracking and reminders - **Our advantage:** Agentic intelligence and fairness enforcement

**Family AI Assistants - Wolfmates, Milo, Ohai (2/5 capabilities):** - Helpful: Centralized family communication, shared calendars, activity coordination - Missing: Multi-tenant architecture (parent manages, not group coordinates), peer group optimization - **Their lane:** Individual serving hierarchical families - **Our advantage:** True multi-tenant for peer groups

**Enterprise Multi-Agent Systems (2.5/5 capabilities):** - Sophisticated: Advanced coordination, autonomous workflows - Missing: Consumer focus, appropriate pricing, household use cases - **Their lane:** Business automation - **Our advantage:** Consumer-focused simplicity and pricing

**What Collective Does Differently:**

**Unit of Optimization:** The GROUP, not the individual

Every other AI asks: "How can I help YOU be more productive?"

Collective asks: "How can I make THIS GROUP function smoothly?"

**Autonomous Coordination:** Makes decisions, doesn't just facilitate

Splitwise: "Here's how much everyone owes" (you still chase payments)

Collective: "I've calculated splits, sent payment requests, tracked payments, and will remind if overdue" (it does the work)

**Comprehensive Resource Management:** Not just money or not just schedules - everything

Chores, expenses, shopping, scheduling, contributions, conflicts - all in one system with cross-resource optimization.

**Fairness Enforcement:** Not just tracking, but actively balancing

Other tools show you data. Collective acts on data to maintain fairness.

"Marcus is falling behind on chores. I'm redistributing to maintain balance."

**Network Effects:** Gets MORE valuable as more people in your life use it

Single-user assistants have zero network effects.

Collective: "Your flatmate uses it? You should too. Your sports team uses it? Join them. Your family uses it? Everyone benefits."

## THE BUSINESS MODEL

### Pricing Structure

**Group Subscription Model:** - \$20/month per group (not per person) - Flatmates (4 people): \$5/person/month - Sports team (15 people): \$1.33/person/month - Family (5 people): \$4/person/month

**Why this works:** - Shared cost = low friction adoption - One person can pay for whole group, or split evenly - Lower per-person cost than individual AI assistants (\$10-15/month) - Higher total revenue per customer unit (group vs. individual)

**Economic Advantages Over 1:1 AI Assistants:**

**AI Costs Comparison:**

Traditional 1:1 AI Assistant: - LLM API calls: ~\$0.30-0.50/user/month - Infrastructure: ~\$0.10/user/month - Total: ~\$0.40-0.60/user/month

Collective (multi-tenant): - LLM API calls: ~\$0.15-0.25/user/month - Infrastructure: ~\$0.05/user/month - Total: ~\$0.20-0.30/user/month

**Why 40-50% cheaper per user:** 1. Batch processing: One analysis of group dynamics serves 4-15 people 2. Shared context: Don't re-learn individual preferences constantly 3. Fewer interactions per person: Group-level decisions reduce individual queries 4. Economies of scale: Coordination logic shared across members

**Better unit economics than individual assistants while delivering MORE value.**

**Free Tier:** - Basic features for groups up to 4 people - Manual expense entry (no automatic detection) - Simple chore tracking - Limited integrations

**Premium Tier (\$20/month):** - Unlimited group size - Automatic expense detection from connected accounts - Full calendar integration and scheduling - Smart shopping coordination - Advanced fairness algorithms - Priority support

**Enterprise Tier (Custom Pricing):** - For small businesses, co-working spaces, community organizations - Enhanced admin controls - Multi-group management - API access for custom integrations - White-label options

### Monetization Advantages

**Higher willingness to pay:** - Coordination pain is HIGH - Shared cost is LOW (divided among group) - Clear value (hours saved, resentment avoided)

**Network effects drive growth:** - One user brings flatmates - Those flatmates bring their sports teams - Sports teams bring their families - Viral growth within social networks

**Strong retention:** - Switching costs HIGH (requires whole group to migrate) - Continuous value delivery (weekly coordination) - Increasing value over time (AI learns group patterns)

**Expansion revenue:** - Users typically belong to multiple groups (flatmates + sports team + family) - Each group is a separate subscription - Power users: 3-5 group subscriptions = \$60-100/month

## THE DEMO

**Setup:**

Split screen showing two scenarios:

**Left side: Before Collective** - Group chat with 127 unread messages - Confused calendar with double-bookings - Spreadsheet for expense tracking (last updated 3 weeks ago) - Person frantically texting: "Whose turn is it to buy groceries?" - Resentment building (unequal contribution, no visibility)

**Right side: After Collective (One Month Later)** - 8 total notifications (all actionable) - Calendar perfectly coordinated - Expenses automatically tracked and settled - Shopping coordinated proactively - Contribution dashboard showing perfect balance - Everyone satisfied

**Metrics shown:**

**Time saved:** 6 hours per person per month (24 hours total for 4-person household)

**Coordination friction:** 127 messages → 8 notifications (94% reduction)

**Expense accuracy:** Manual tracking (65% of expenses logged) → Automatic (98% of expenses logged)

**Fairness satisfaction:** Before: 40% of group satisfied with contribution balance → After: 95% satisfied

**Visible AI labor:** "This month, Collective made 127 autonomous decisions for your group: - 23 chore assignments - 18 shopping coordinations - 12 expense splits and settlements - 8 calendar optimizations - 4 conflict mediations - 62 proactive suggestions"

## AGENTIC CAPABILITY SPECIFICATION

**Level Classification:** Level 3 (Cross-System Agentic Workflow Orchestration)

**What this means:** - Autonomous execution across multiple systems (calendar, payment, communication, shopping) - Multi-step reasoning and planning (if X then Y, considering group context) - Proactive intervention without human prompting - Fair division and optimization algorithms - Learning and adaptation over time

**What makes it Level 3 (not Level 2):** - Coordinates MULTIPLE subsystems and resources simultaneously - Balances competing preferences and constraints across group members - Orchestrates complex workflows (shopping coordination involves: list management, proximity detection, expense tracking, payment requests, inventory updates) - Supervised decision-making with escalation (acts autonomously within bounds, asks group for major decisions)

**What keeps it below Level 4:** - Operates within single group boundary (not cross-organizational) - Doesn't negotiate with external AIs autonomously - Requires initial human configuration and permission - Escalates to humans for major conflicts or preference changes

**Technical Feasibility:** HIGH - All components proven and deployable with current technology (2025) - MCP enables multi-integration without custom builds - Fair division algorithms exist in academic literature - Multi-tenant architecture proven in enterprise SaaS

**Production-Ready:** YES (6-month build timeline realistic)

## SIX-MONTH BUILD

### Development Roadmap

**Month 1-2: Core Infrastructure** - Multi-tenant database architecture - User authentication and group creation - Basic calendar integration (Google, Outlook) - Simple chore assignment and tracking - Expense logging (manual entry)

**Alpha Testing:** Internal team + 3 test groups (15 users total)

**Month 3-4: Autonomous Features** - Automatic fair chore allocation algorithms - Payment integration (Venmo, PayPal) - Automatic expense detection - Shopping list and coordination - Scheduling optimization (multi-calendar) - Push notifications and reminders

**Beta Testing:** 50 groups (200 users), mostly shared housing

**Month 5-6: Intelligence and Polish** - Preference learning and personalization - Proactive suggestions and interventions - Contribution balancing and fairness enforcement - Dashboard and reporting - Mobile app polish - Conflict detection and mediation support

**Expanded Beta:** 200 groups (800 users), diverse group types

**Month 6: Launch** - Public release - App Store and Play Store - Marketing to shared housing communities - Referral program for viral growth

### Technical Feasibility: MEDIUM

**Proven Components:** - Calendar APIs (well-documented, reliable) - Payment integrations (standard OAuth flows) - Multi-user systems (established patterns) - Fair division algorithms (academic research exists) - Push notifications (standard mobile development)

**Complex Components:** - Multi-tenant architecture (requires careful design) - Fairness preference balancing (subjective, requires testing) - Conflict mediation logic (human judgment is complex) - Real-time coordination at scale (optimization challenges)

**Not Building:** - Novel AI models (use existing LLMs for natural language) - Custom payment processing (integrate existing platforms) - Proprietary scheduling algorithms (use constraint satisfaction)

**Using:** - OpenAI or Anthropic for natural language understanding - Standard calendar APIs (Google, Microsoft) - Existing payment platforms (Venmo, PayPal APIs) - Proven database systems (PostgreSQL with multi-tenancy support)

### Team Required

- 2 backend engineers (multi-tenant architecture, API integrations)
- 2 frontend engineers (iOS/Android apps, web dashboard)
- 1 designer (UX for multi-user coordination is complex)
- 1 product manager (coordinate development, user testing)
- 1 data engineer (fairness algorithms, analytics)

**Total: 7 people for 6 months**

### Cost Estimate

**Development:** ~\$300-400k (team costs for 6 months)

**Infrastructure:** ~\$5-10k (cloud hosting, APIs, testing)

**User Acquisition:** \$50-100k (initial marketing, referral incentives)

**Total: ~\$400-500k to launch**

## THE RISKS

### Risk 1: Adoption Requires Group Consensus

**Problem:** Unlike individual apps where one person decides to adopt, Collective requires the WHOLE GROUP to agree and onboard.

**Mitigation:** - Free tier for initial adoption (lower barrier) - Single-person can set up and invite others - Gradual feature unlock (basic features work with 2 people, full features with whole group) - Strong network effects once first person adopts

**Likelihood:** HIGH (this is inherent to the model)  
**Impact:** MEDIUM (slows growth but doesn't prevent it)

### Risk 2: Privacy and Trust

**Problem:** People must share calendar access, payment data, and household information with group members. Privacy concerns could limit adoption.

**Mitigation:** - Granular privacy controls (choose what's visible to group) - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data - Transparent data handling (users see exactly what's shared) - Easy opt-out and data deletion - Collective never sells data or shares outside the group

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** MEDIUM (some users will refuse, but target market is more trusting)

### Risk 3: Fairness Algorithm Disputes

**Problem:** AI deciding what's "fair" is subjective. Different people have different fairness intuitions. Disputes could undermine trust.

**Mitigation:** - Multiple fairness models (groups choose their preference) - Full transparency (AI shows its reasoning) - Manual override always available - Regular fairness model reviews (groups can change approach) - Conflict escalation to human discussion (AI facilitates, doesn't replace)

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** MEDIUM (can be managed with good design)

### Risk 4: Technical Complexity

**Problem:** Multi-tenant systems are harder to build than single-user. Calendar/payment integrations can be brittle. Scheduling optimization is computationally complex.

**Mitigation:** - Start with simpler features (manual entry before automation) - Use proven integration platforms (not custom builds) - Extensive testing with real groups before launch - Graceful degradation (if automation fails, fall back to manual)

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** HIGH (technical failures destroy trust in coordination context)

### Risk 5: Competitive Response

**Problem:** Splitwise or Flatastic could add the features we're building. Big tech could enter the space.

**Mitigation:** - Network effects and first-mover advantage (18-24 month head start) - Comprehensive solution vs. point solutions (harder to replicate full feature set) - Superior AI capability (we're building agentic from day one) - Speed to market (launch before competitors recognize the opportunity)

**Competitive Timeline Assessment:** - Splitwise adds chores: 12-18 months (30% probability) - Flatastic adds AI: 18-24 months (40% probability) - Big tech enters: 24-36 months (10% probability in next 24 months)

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** HIGH (but we have 18-24 month window)

### Risk 6: Group Dynamics and Interpersonal Conflict

**Problem:** When the AI mediates group coordination, it can become a scapegoat for interpersonal tensions. "The app is being unfair" might mask "I don't like Marcus."

**Mitigation:** - AI explicitly disclaims replacing human communication - Conflict escalation prompts: "This seems like a conversation for the group, not the AI" - Transparent contribution data (facts reduce disputes) - AI as tool, not authority (group always has final say)

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** LOW (good design can minimize this)

## THE OPPORTUNITY

### Market Size

**Shared Housing (Primary Target):** - 30-40 million Americans in shared housing arrangements - Mostly urban, young professionals and students - High pain, high density, tech-savvy

**Families (Secondary Target):** - 40 million US households with children under 18 - Complex scheduling, high coordination needs - Willingness to pay for reduced family friction

**Recreational Groups (Tertiary Target):** - 100+ million Americans in organized group activities - Sports teams, hobby groups, book clubs, volunteer organizations - Lower willingness to pay but massive scale

**Small Organizations (Enterprise):** - 30 million small businesses in US - Co-working spaces, community organizations - Higher willingness to pay, longer sales cycles

**Conservative TAM:** 10 million groups (averaging 5 people per group) at \$20/month = \$2.4B annual recurring revenue market

### Why Now

**Technology Readiness:** - Agentic AI capabilities (Level 2-3) are proven and deployable - MCP standardization makes multi-integration feasible (November 2024) - Calendar/payment APIs are mature and reliable

**Market Readiness:** - People are exhausted by group chat chaos - Remote/hybrid work increased shared housing and distributed coordination needs - AI assistant adoption growing (people understand the value proposition)

**Competitive Window:** - No major player focused on multi-tenant coordination - Microsoft/Google/Apple all building individual assistants - **18-24 month window before big tech catches on**

**Market Research Validation:** - Existing products are point solutions (expenses OR chores OR scheduling) - No autonomous allocation exists in consumer market - Multi-tenant architecture proven in enterprise but not applied to consumer groups - All five critical capabilities validated as absent in current market

### Why This Wins

**Network Effects:** - First multi-tenant AI wins the network - Every group that adopts makes it more valuable for adjacent groups - Viral growth within social networks

**Switching Costs:** - Once a group adopts, switching requires everyone to move - Collective becomes infrastructure for group coordination - High retention, low churn

**Category Creation:** - Not competing with existing assistants (different job-to-be-done) - Creating new category: "Multi-Tenant Coordination AI" - Category leaders capture outsized value

**Expanding Use Cases:** - Start with shared housing - Expand to families, sports teams, friend groups - Enterprise upsell to small businesses - Multiple groups per user = high LTV

**Superior Economics:** - 40-50% lower AI costs per user than 1:1 assistants - Higher total revenue per customer unit (group subscription) - Better margins at scale

## THE ASK

Build Collective. Six months. Prove the multi-tenant coordination concept.

**Initial Focus:** Shared housing (flatmates, roommates) - High pain, high density, tech-savvy users - Viral growth through social networks - Clear value proposition (hours saved, resentment avoided)

**Success Metrics (6 Months):** - 500 active groups (2,000-2,500 users) - 60%+ weekly active rate (groups use it continuously) - 4+ hours saved per person per month (measured through time tracking) - 70%+ fairness satisfaction (surveyed users feel contribution is balanced) - 40%+ conversion to paid (from free tier) - NPS > 50 (users enthusiastically recommend to other groups)

**If it works:** We've validated a new category of AI - multi-tenant coordination - with massive market potential and strong defensibility. **Market research confirms no existing product combines all five critical capabilities we're delivering.**

**This is the right bet.** Multi-tenant coordination is genuine validated white space. Nobody's building this.

**Let's build it.**
